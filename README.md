Workflow Timer - Google Chrome Extension

Overview

Workflow Timer is a minimalist Google Chrome extension designed to help you manage your time effectively. It allows you to set timers in 1-hour increments, aiding in productivity and time-blocking strategies. The extension was initially created in late 2023 using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with React for development. In January 2024, the extension was updated to conform to Google Chrome's Manifest Version 3 standard.
